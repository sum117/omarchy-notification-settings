# 🔔 Omarchy Notifications Settings

This fork fixes settings-panel dismissal (click the bell again, press Escape,
or click outside) and makes notification badges and OTP buttons follow
Omarchy's corner setting, including square corners. It also removes tracked
Python bytecode and ignores generated Python caches.

The plugin ID remains `andrewscofield.notifications-settings` for compatibility
with existing installations. Upstream: [andrewscofield/omarchy-notification-settings](https://github.com/andrewscofield/omarchy-notification-settings).

The settings panel uses Omarchy's native themed controls and opens beside the
clicked bell. Tab navigates controls; Enter/Space activates them, and Escape
closes the panel. The bell changes to its crossed-out companion when DND is on.
Notification text follows the shell font, and previews expire automatically.

History opens as a searchable, scrolling list inside the panel, including active
alerts and up to 100 recent archived entries. Search matches app, title, message,
and channel. Right-click an entry or use × to remove it. Clear history removes
archived entries while keeping active alerts. Reading history never replays
notifications onto the desktop. Desktop toasts are hidden while this panel is
open, so its full-screen dismissal surface cannot intercept their controls.

Live notifications expose the sending app's action buttons. Clicking the card
runs its default action, or focuses the app if no default action is available.
Archived notifications can only focus an existing app window; expired action
callbacks cannot be replayed. Right-clicking a toast (including its code-copy
button) dismisses it, and a visible Dismiss button is also available.
Toast windows fit their visible cards and use the native Wayland input region;
they do not rely on a full-screen click-through mask. Long stacks scroll within
the available screen height.

## ✨ Features

- 🎛️ **Dedicated Bar Widget & Control Panel:**
  - Placed anywhere on your status bar (`left`, `center`, or `right`).
  - When placed in the center section, it seamlessly reveals on hover alongside your other utility indicators.
  - Left-click opens the configuration popup; right-click quickly toggles **Do Not Disturb** mode.
- 📋 **Automatic 2FA / OTP Code Extraction & 1-Click Copy:**
  - Automatically parses incoming verification notifications (Google, GitHub, Slack, Signal, Steam, Discord, banks, and more) for one-time passcodes and security tokens.
  - Automatically strips service prefixes (e.g. `G-492019` becomes pure `492019`) so you copy only the numbers you need to enter.
  - Injects a native, prominent **"Copy Code: XXXXXX"** button directly on the notification card.
  - Copies directly to your Wayland clipboard via `wl-copy` with instant visual confirmation (`✓ Copied to Clipboard!`).
- 📐 **6 Dynamic Screen Positions:**
  - Easily place notification toasts anywhere on your screen:
    - **Top Left**, **Top Center**, **Top Right**
    - **Bottom Left**, **Bottom Center**, **Bottom Right**
  - Card alignment, stacking order, and status bar clearance adjust automatically.
- 🗂️ **Smart Notification Grouping:**
  - **1 Per Channel (Default):** Keeps at most 1 active alert per channel or conversation (e.g. messages in `#dev` and `#general` stay separate, but rapid posts in `#dev` won't flood your screen).
  - **1 Per App:** Keeps 1 alert per application total (newer alerts from the same app supersede older ones).
  - **All Alerts:** Displays all incoming notifications without deduplication.
- 🏷️ **Conversation & Channel Badges:**
  - Automatically identifies channels and groups from DBus hints (`tag`, `x-kde-tag`, `group`) and title syntax.
  - Displays a clean accent-colored breadcrumb badge (`Slack · [ #dev ]`) right on the card.
- ⏱️ **Configurable Display Timeouts:**
  - Choose auto-dismiss timing: **3s**, **5s**, **8s**, **12s**, or **15s**.
- 💬 **Sticky Chat Alerts:**
  - Messaging apps like **Slack** and **Signal** stay visible until dismissed so you never miss urgent communications.
- 👁️ **Live Notification Preview:**
  - One-click **"Preview Notification Toast"** button inside the settings panel lets you immediately test your active position, duration, grouping, and OTP copy button in real time.
- 💾 **Session Resilience & History:**
  - Survives shell reloads and restarts, restoring live popups without duplicating expired toasts. Replay recent notifications at any time.

## 🔒 Security & Hardened Architecture

This plugin adheres to strict security and privilege boundary standards:

1. **No Executable Payload Data:**
   - Arbitrary command execution hints (such as `omarchy-exec`) have been completely removed.
   - Notification cards never execute shell commands when clicked. Standard client callbacks use the native FreeDesktop `default` action invoked over DBus within the originating client's process boundary.
2. **Hard Producer-Side Field & Cardinality Bounds:**
   - String inputs are capped before entering QML (`app` <= 64B, `summary` <= 256B, `body` <= 2048B, `glyph` <= 8B, `channel` <= 64B, `appIcon` <= 256B, `image` <= 512B).
   - Dangerous ASCII control characters are stripped.
   - Active toast cardinality is capped to a maximum of 20 concurrent popups (`maxActivePopups = 20`) to prevent UI resource exhaustion.
3. **Hardened Text Sinks:**
   - All text sinks in `NotificationCard.qml` explicitly specify `textFormat: Text.PlainText`. Default `AutoText` and `StyledText` markup rendering are disabled, eliminating HTML/rich-text injection vectors.
4. **Strict Image Scheme Allowlist:**
   - App icons and images are verified before loading: only local files (`file:///` or `/`), in-process `image://` providers, or standard themed icon names are permitted.
   - Remote URL schemes (`http://`, `https://`, `data:`, `qrc:`, etc.) and path traversal sequences (`..`) are strictly rejected.
5. **Private Descriptor & Atomic State Persistence (`scripts/storage.sh`):**
   - Verified private directories (`~/.local/state/omarchy/notifications/`, `history/`, `images/`) are initialized with mode `0700` (`umask 077`) and verified not to be symlinks.
   - Notification and settings writes use exclusive temporary files in the same directory (`0600`) followed by atomic rename (`mv -f`).
   - Bounded reads (`head -c 32768`) reject symlinks (`! -L`) and enforce strict timestamp-id filename matching (`^[0-9]+-[0-9]+\.json$`).

## 📦 Dependencies

All dependencies are standard in default Omarchy installations:
- **Quickshell** (included in Omarchy Quattro)
- **wl-clipboard** (`wl-copy` for 1-click OTP clipboard copying)
- **libnotify** (`notify-send` for preview simulations)
- **Nerd Font** (system icon glyphs)

## 🚀 Replacement Notification Server Setup

Because only one service can own the `org.freedesktop.Notifications` DBus session name at a time, this plugin acts as a **complete drop-in replacement** for the built-in `omarchy.notifications` service.

### 1. Installation

Clone this repository into your Omarchy plugins directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sum117/omarchy-notification-settings.git ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/andrewscofield.notifications-settings
```

### 2. Enable in Shell Configuration

Edit `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:
- Add `"andrewscofield.notifications-settings"` to `"plugins"`
- Add `"omarchy.notifications"` to `"disabledPlugins"` (disables stock daemon so this plugin claims DBus `org.freedesktop.Notifications`)

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    { "id": "andrewscofield.notifications-settings" }
  ],
  "disabledPlugins": [
    "omarchy.notifications"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Add to Bar Layout (Optional)

To place the notification bell directly in your bar, add it to `bar.layout` in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:

```json
{
  "bar": {
    "layout": {
      "center": [
        { "id": "andrewscofield.notifications-settings" },
        { "id": "omarchy.clock" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

*(Note: If you use `andrew.indicators`, the DND indicator can also directly trigger the settings panel).*

### 4. Restart Shell

Restart Omarchy Quattro to activate the replacement notification daemon:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

---

## 🔄 Reverting to Stock Notifications

If you ever wish to switch back to the default Omarchy notification daemon:

1. In `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:
   - Remove `"omarchy.notifications"` from `"disabledPlugins"`
   - Remove `"andrewscofield.notifications-settings"` from `"plugins"` and `"bar.layout"`
2. Restart the shell:
   ```bash
   omarchy restart shell
   ```

---

## Development checks

Run `node tests/panel.test.cjs` and `node tests/history.test.cjs` for panel,
search, and history identity regressions. On an Omarchy installation, run
`python3 tests/run-card-input.py` to exercise the actual card pointer handlers
in an isolated offscreen Quickshell instance.
